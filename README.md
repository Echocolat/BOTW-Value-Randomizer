## BOTW Value Randomizer by Echocolat

First, make sure the `oead` and `bcml` modules are installed. Then, you can just launch the `value_randomizer.py` script and choose your options.  
If you don't want to install the mod now with BCML, just press anything when the script asks you. If you want to install it directly, press "y" when it asks you.  
You will still be able to install it after though.

#### If it doesn't work

Make sure you have `oead` and `bcml` modules installed. If it still doesn't work, feel free to comment on the Gamebanana page or to contact me through Discord
