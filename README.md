## BOTW Value Randomizer by Echocolat

First, make sure the `oead` and `bcml` modules are installed. Then, you can just launch the `value_randomizer.py` script and choose your options.  
After that, install the newly created mod with BCML (install the "BOTW Value Randomizer/rules.txt"). And enjoy !

#### If it doesn't work

Make sure you have `oead` and `bcml` modules installed. If it still doesn't work, feel free to comment on the Gamebanana page or to contact me through Discord
